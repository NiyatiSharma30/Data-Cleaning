# Data-Cleaning
Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data wrangling, is the process of identifying and correcting (or removing) errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data to improve its quality. It ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and usable for analysis or machine learning models. Some key aspects of data cleaning include:

Handling Missing Values: Filling in missing data with appropriate values (mean, median, mode) or removing incomplete records.

Fixing Data Types: Ensuring data is in the correct format (e.g., dates, numbers, categories).

Removing Duplicates: Identifying and eliminating redundant entries in datasets.

Handling Outliers: Detecting and dealing with anomalous data points that may skew analysis.

Standardizing Data: Ensuring consistency in naming conventions, units of measure, or categorization.

Dealing with Inconsistent Data: Correcting any discrepancies in data that should be uniform across a dataset.

Clean data is essential for producing accurate, reliable results from analysis and machine learning models!
